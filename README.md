# liver-cancer-pred

Playground for trying to predict liver cancer

### How to run NN_playground.py

    git clone git@github.com:shinjinighosh/liver-cancer-pred.git
    cd liver-cancer-pred
    python NN_playground.py

If `python NN_playground.py` does not work, it could be because of multiple python versions or virtual environments being around on your system. Try `python3 NN_playground.py`!

You can look at the model loss and accuracies on both training and test sets in `Loss.png` and `Accuracy.png` respectively. The confusion matrix is plotted prettily at `Confusion_matrix.png`.

The model metrics are printed at the end. Feel free to play around with the model!
